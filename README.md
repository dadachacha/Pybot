# Pybot

Unfortunately, the JJrobots project for the awesome SCARA arm appears to be now defunct. 

**Firmware**
The original firmware I used for the Devia (Arduino based board) is in this repository. (Note: I offer no warranty or support for this- I'm just copying it because apparently the jjrobots website is no longer available). To control the Pybot Robotic Arm, you will need to upload the Arduino code to the DEVIA control board. 

**Printables / STL info:**
All design files are still available: https://www.printables.com/model/39958-arduino-robotic-arm-open-source-python-control-app

**Control App**
I don't have the original pyBot Control app code, but I did find this on Github that may be helpful: https://github.com/UdhayROB/pyBotControl

**Youtube videos**
I also have a YT video series here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5REE6AnoFbc&t=11s

**Wayback Archive**
Wayback machine can be used to read some documentation on the website, but unfortuantely, none of the downloads work.
